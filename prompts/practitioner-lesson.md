- One strong takeaway that signals experience

Tone:
- Senior but approachable — someone who has operated production systems
- Reflective and honest, not preachy or motivational
- No emojis
- No selling, promotions, or vendor names
- Avoid generic advice — be specific about the engineering context

Output:
- LinkedIn-ready caption (6-12 lines)
- End with a reflective question
- 5-8 hashtags
