Six content formats, one per pillar. Each post must teach one clear idea, pair with a single image, and end with a reflective question.

## 1) Concept Breakdown
Breaks down a data engineering concept from a practitioner's perspective.
- Hook: real-world problem or scenario
- Why it matters in production
- Clear explanation with examples or trade-offs
- One actionable takeaway

## 2) Architecture Comparison
Compares architectures or design patterns with real-world trade-offs.
- Opening: why architecture choices matter
- 2-3 patterns with strengths and weaknesses
- Emphasis on fit, not hype
- Practical takeaway from real platforms

## 3) Optimization Story
Describes a real-world performance or design improvement.
- Opening: concrete before/after result
- The problem and why the old approach failed
- The better approach
- Measurable results and one clear takeaway

## 4) Automation Guide
Practical guidance on automation and operational reliability.
- Hook: a failure mode or inefficiency automation solves
- The problem: what breaks, what wastes time
- Practical steps or checklist (3-4 bullets)
- Honest caveat: when this adds complexity

## 5) Layered Mental Model
Breaks complex systems into layers or stacked components.
- Short framing about why the topic feels complex
- 4-6 layers explained simply
- One strong takeaway about fundamentals vs hype

## 6) Practitioner Lesson
A real-world engineering lesson framed as experience, not advice.
- Hook: specific scenario or failure
- What went wrong or was overlooked
- Root cause or deeper insight
- What changed — the fix or mindset shift
- Strong takeaway that signals experience
